                        <p>Welcome! I am Kelly Michelson! I am originally from Phoenix, Arizona, but when I was five, my family moved to Walla Walla, Washington. I am 18 years old and I am currently attending Gonzaga University. I am working towards my Bachelors degree in Business Administration with a concentration in Marketing. As of right now I should be able to graudate in 3 years since I was involved in Running Start, while in high school. </p>

                        <p>My family and friends are a big part of my life and are the reason for where I am today. I have a great support system! I have a pretty big family. I have two half-sisters and two step-sisters...I know, a lot of girls! I have a lot of friends, new and old, that I would also consider family. I would say my family and friends are the biggest aspect of my life and I would do anything for them!</p>
                        <p>I love to travel and explore new places with the people I love. I hope one day I will be able to see more of the world! I have been fortunate enough to already have traveled to some fun places, but I want to continue to add to the list and experience different cultures and areas around the world.</p>
                        <p>Summer is my favorite time of year. You will find me hanging out with my family and friends, boating, and soaking up the sun and warm weather.</p>

                        <p>As stated up above, I am currently attending Gonzaga University. I have been around the college and watching it's basketball team ever since I was young. My mom, aunt, uncle, and a few distant relatives, all attended Gonzaga University as well. So it is safe to say I have been a zag fan since I was little and I have been a big fan of the Men's Basketball team. One of my favorite moments in zag history has to be when Jalen Suggs hit his buzzer beater, half-court shot against UCLA in the final four game.  </p>
